### Simon Game

This is a browser-based implementation of the classic electronic game "Simon." The game randomly flashes a sequence of colored buttons, and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. The game gets progressively more difficult as the player successfully completes each level.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses the jQuery library for DOM manipulation.

## How to Play

To start the game, press any key on the keyboard. The game will display a sequence of colored buttons, and you must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. Each time you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add another color to the sequence, making it progressively more difficult. If you make a mistake and click the wrong button, the game will end and you'll have to start over.

## Features

- Randomized game sequence: The game generates a random sequence of colored buttons for the player to repeat.
- Dynamic difficulty: The game gets progressively more difficult as the player successfully completes each level.
- Sound effects: The game plays a unique sound effect for each button press and game over event.
- Responsive design: The game's layout adapts to different screen sizes.
